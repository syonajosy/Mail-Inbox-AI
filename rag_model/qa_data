However, these overcharges have had a significant and unexpected impact on our budgeting. I kindly request you, as the Operations Manager, to discuss this issue with XYZ Supplies' representative at your earliest convenience. It would be beneficial if we could seek clarification on these price hikes and potentially negotiate a reduction moving forwards. We would also appreciate an immediate update of this resolution because this issue must be resolved promptly to ensure a meticulous and clean record for our quarterly audit scheduled for July 15th, 2023.<br><br>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
