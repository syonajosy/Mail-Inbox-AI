Ensure that all placeholders (e.g., recipient name, date, venue, RSVP deadline, speaker names, company details) are replaced with appropriate, realistic values. The email must include:

    - A subject line starting with 'Subject:' that is relevant, engaging, and informative.
    - A professional greeting that directly addresses a specific recipient (e.g., "Dear John Doe," or "Hello Sarah,").
    - A fully detailed email body with 2-3 well-structured paragraphs that clearly convey the purpose, key details, and any necessary actions. Avoid vague placeholdersâ€”use realistic event details, names, and deadlines.
    - A professional closing with an appropriate sign-off (e.g., "Best regards," "Sincerely," etc.), followed by a realistic sender name, title, and organization.

    Ensure the email is polished, professional, and free from placeholders or incomplete details. Output only the fully written email without explanations.
