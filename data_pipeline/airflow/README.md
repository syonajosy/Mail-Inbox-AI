# InboxAI Data Pipeline

## Description

The InboxAI Data Pipeline is a modular, production-grade email processing system built using Apache Airflow and containerized via Docker Compose. It automates the ingestion, transformation, and semantic indexing of Gmail data, enabling efficient downstream querying and analysis. The pipeline is decomposed into orchestrated DAGs covering email batching, raw data fetching, HTML/PII-safe preprocessing, and embedding generation using OpenAI models. It integrates with Google Cloud Storage for data persistence, ChromaDB for vector-based retrieval, and PostgreSQL for metadata logging. Failures and anomalies are captured using robust validation and alerting mechanisms via SMTP. Designed with CI/CD in mind, the system is deployed through a GitHub Actions workflow that validates pipeline health, syncs DAGs, and ensures reproducibility. This pipeline underpins InboxAI's intelligent email assistant, supporting real-time and batch-triggered email processing with high reliability and scalability.

The deployed airflow can be used using the endpoint: http://144.24.127.222:8080/

Absolutely! Here’s a **standardized Airflow `## 🛠️ Setup Instructions` section** and a tailored **`.env` sample**—modeled after your backend, but adapted to your Airflow + GCS + Gmail + ChromaDB stack:

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Google Cloud SDK

Follow the official guide to install the Google Cloud SDK:  
[Installing Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

After installation, initialize the SDK:

```bash
gcloud init
```

---

### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

---

### 3. Set the Active Project

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

---

### 4. Enable Required APIs

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  storage.googleapis.com \
  iam.googleapis.com \
  gmail.googleapis.com \
  logging.googleapis.com
```

---

### 5. Create a Service Account and Assign Roles

```bash
# Create a new service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create airflow-pipeline \
  --display-name="Airflow Pipeline Service Account"

# Assign roles to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:airflow-pipeline@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \

---

## 🔐 Sample `.env` File

Here's a placeholder `.env` file tailored for the Airflow deployment:

```env
# PostgreSQL Configuration
DB_NAME=airflow
DB_USER=airflow
DB_PASSWORD=airflow
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432

# Gmail API & GCS Configuration
CREDENTIAL_PATH_FOR_GMAIL_API=/opt/airflow/config/credentials.json
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/opt/airflow/config/google_sa.json
BUCKET_NAME=inboxai-bucket
EMAIL_FOLDER=emails
THREAD_FOLDER=threads

# SMTP (for deployment and pipeline failure alerts)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
SMTP_MAIL_FROM=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_SSL=True
SMTP_STARTTLS=False
ALERT_EMAIL=your-alert-email@northeastern.edu
AIRFLOW_ALERT_EMAIL=your-alert-email@northeastern.edu

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# ChromaDB
CHROMA_HOST_URL=http://your_chroma_host
CHROMA_PORT=8000

# Optional: pip install on container start (usually empty)
_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS=
```

> Save this as `data_pipeline/.env` and add the full file content to your `AIRFLOW_ENV` GitHub secret.

---

Certainly! Here's a **GitHub Actions Workflow** section tailored for your Airflow deployment, in the same style as your backend:

---

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline for Airflow is defined in `.github/workflows/airflow-setup.yml` and automates deployment to a self-hosted server using Docker Compose.

### 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. **Checkout Code**  
   Pulls the latest version of the `data_pipeline/` directory from the main branch.

2. **Generate Credential Files**  
   Dynamically creates the following from GitHub Secrets:
   - `credentials.json` (Gmail OAuth2 credentials)
   - `google_sa.json` (GCP service account for GCS & logging)
   - `.env` (environment configuration)

3. **Clean Previous Deployment (if exists)**  
   Stops and removes existing containers and volumes (Airflow and VectorDB) from `$HOME/airflow`.

4. **Copy Pipeline Code to Server Directory**  
   Copies the contents of `data_pipeline/` into `$HOME/airflow`.

5. **Docker Compose Up – Airflow**  
   Builds and starts the Airflow stack (`webserver`, `scheduler`, `worker`, `triggerer`) using Docker Compose.

6. **Docker Compose Up – Vector DB (Optional)**  
   If a `vector-database` service is configured, it is brought up after a delay.

7. **Health Checks**  
   - ✅ **Airflow Health**: Verifies that the scheduler and triggerer services are healthy via `/health` endpoint  
   - ✅ **ChromaDB Health** (if available): Checks `/api/v2/heartbeat` endpoint for vector DB readiness

8. **Email Notifications**  
   - 📩 **Success:** Sends a success email via SMTP
   - 🚨 **Failure:** Sends a failure notification if any step fails

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
pytest data_pipeline/airflow/dags/tests/ -v -W ignore::DeprecationWarning
```
---

Absolutely! Here's the **standardized Post-Deployment Health Check** section for your Airflow `README.md`, consistent with the backend style but tailored to the Airflow setup:

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Health Check

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically performs a health check on the Airflow deployment to ensure the scheduler and triggerer services are running as expected.

### 🔍 What’s Checked

- **Airflow Webserver:** Accessible via `http://<HOST>:8080`
- **Scheduler & Triggerer:** Verified via `/health` endpoint

### 🧪 Example Health Check (via `curl`)

```bash
curl http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:8080/health
```

### ✅ Expected JSON Response

```json
{
  "metadatabase": {
    "status": "healthy"
  },
  "scheduler": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "latest_scheduler_heartbeat": "2025-04-19T23:35:15.311867+00:00"
  },
  "triggerer": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "latest_triggerer_heartbeat": "2025-04-19T23:35:16.837162+00:00"
  },
  "dag_processor": {
    "status": null,
    "latest_dag_processor_heartbeat": null
  }
}
```

> The `scheduler` and `triggerer` statuses **must be `healthy`** for a successful deployment.

If any service reports as unhealthy, the GitHub Actions workflow will fail and trigger an email alert with failure diagnostics.
